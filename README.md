# Form Validation Application

This project is a form validation application built using Next.js, React Hook Form, and Yup. It provides an efficient and user-friendly way to validate form inputs and handle form submissions.

## Features

- **Next.js**: The project is built on Next.js, a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and other powerful features out of the box.
- **React Hook Form**: The application utilizes React Hook Form, a lightweight library for managing form state and validation in React. It offers a simple and intuitive API for handling form inputs and validation rules.
- **Yup**: Form validation is performed using Yup, a schema validation library for JavaScript. Yup provides a flexible and declarative way to define validation rules for different form fields.
- **Efficient Validation**: The application performs real-time validation on form inputs, providing instant feedback to users on any errors or validation issues.
- **Customizable Error Messages**: You can easily customize the error messages displayed to users based on the validation rules defined using Yup.
- **Form Submission**: The application handles form submissions, allowing you to define custom logic to process and submit the form data.
- **Responsive Design**: The form is designed to be responsive and accessible, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## ABOUT ME 
I am delighted that you have taken an interest in my project. At 26 years old, I hold a degree in mechanical engineering. Following graduation, I spent approximately five months working as an engineer in a specific field. However, during this time, I realized that the role did not align with my aspirations and overall satisfaction.

Driven by my passion for coding, software, and computer components, I extensively researched various career options, ultimately gravitating towards web development. The more I delved into this field, the stronger my interest grew. I became determined to excel as a talented frontend web developer. Notably, my engineering background has equipped me with highly organized and systematic work habits, facilitating effective learning and contributing significantly to my educational journey.

I hope this brief introduction has provided you with insight into my background and motivations without becoming overly tedious.
