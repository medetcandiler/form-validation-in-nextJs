# Form Validation Application

This project is a form validation application built using Next.js, React Hook Form, and Yup. It provides an efficient and user-friendly way to validate form inputs and handle form submissions.

## Features

- **Next.js**: The project is built on Next.js, a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and other powerful features out of the box.
- **React Hook Form**: The application utilizes React Hook Form, a lightweight library for managing form state and validation in React. It offers a simple and intuitive API for handling form inputs and validation rules.
- **Yup**: Form validation is performed using Yup, a schema validation library for JavaScript. Yup provides a flexible and declarative way to define validation rules for different form fields.
- **Efficient Validation**: The application performs real-time validation on form inputs, providing instant feedback to users on any errors or validation issues.
- **Customizable Error Messages**: You can easily customize the error messages displayed to users based on the validation rules defined using Yup.
- **Form Submission**: The application handles form submissions, allowing you to define custom logic to process and submit the form data.
- **Responsive Design**: The form is designed to be responsive and accessible, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## ABOUT ME 
Hello. Let me briefly introduce myself to you. First of all I am so glad to see that you are looking at my project. I am 26 years old. I am a mechanical engineer. After my graduation I worked as an engineer in the field somewhere in the region of 5 months. However, after working a few month I felt like it was not for me and I was not happy. After That I decided to research on different careers specifically those that include web development, because I have always been interested in coding, software, computer and its components. After extensive research, I grew more interest towards coding and I felt driven and motivated to become a genuinely brilliant frontend web developer. I would like to add that my education background that engineering has taught me how to work in an higly orginised and systematic way which allows me to learn in an effective way. What I mean is my enginnering background has been making great contrubutions to my learning process. I hope I did not bore you with my brief introduction.
